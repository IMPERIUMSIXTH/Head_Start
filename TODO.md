# AI-Powered Learning Recommendation Platform Setup - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze existing codebase and gather information
- [x] Create comprehensive plan for AI model integration and API endpoints
- [x] Get user approval for the plan
- [x] Create services/ai_client.py for OpenAI integration (gpt-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-small)
- [x] Add POST /resources endpoint to api/content.py for adding learning resources with embeddings
- [x] Add GET /recommend endpoint to api/recommendations.py for personalized recommendations
- [x] Add POST /interactions endpoint to api/content.py for recording user interactions
- [x] Update main.py to include new router if needed
- [x] Generate handover.md summarizing schema, endpoints, and AI model integration

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the new endpoints and AI integration
- [ ] Verify database schema supports pgvector and embeddings
- [ ] Ensure all security practices are implemented

## Notes
- All core functionality has been implemented
- AI client requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- Database schema already supports embeddings (confirmed in models.py and init-db.sql)
- Security practices are implemented (JWT, bcrypt, rate limiting, CORS, input validation)
