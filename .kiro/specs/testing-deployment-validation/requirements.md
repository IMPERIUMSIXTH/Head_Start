# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive testing and deployment readiness validation system for the AI-Powered Learning Recommendation Platform. The system ensures that all code changes undergo rigorous quality assurance through multiple testing layers (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security, accessibility, and regression testing) and validates deployment readiness before production releases. The feature includes automated CI/CD pipeline validation, container build verification, Kubernetes manifest validation, and post-deployment smoke testing to guarantee system reliability and security compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive automated testing coverage across all layers, so that I can confidently deploy code changes without introducing regressions or security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed to any branch THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests using pytest and pytest-asyncio for backend components
2. WHEN code is committed to any branch THEN the system SHALL execute frontend unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
3. WHEN integration tests are triggered THEN the system SHALL validate API endpoints, database interactions, and service integrations
4. WHEN E2E tests are executed THEN the system SHALL use Cypress or Playwright to validate complete user workflows
5. WHEN security testing is performed THEN the system SHALL run OWASP ZAP, Bandit, and CodeQL scans to identify vulnerabilities
6. WHEN accessibility testing is executed THEN the system SHALL use axe-core and Pa11y to ensure WCAG compliance
7. WHEN performance testing is triggered THEN the system SHALL use k6 or Locust to validate system performance under load
8. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide detailed failure reports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment validation and readiness checks, so that I can ensure safe and reliable production deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment validation is triggered THEN the system SHALL validate container builds for both backend and frontend components
2. WHEN Kubernetes manifests are processed THEN the system SHALL run kubectl lint to validate manifest syntax and best practices
3. WHEN Helm charts are used THEN the system SHALL run helm template validation to ensure proper templating
4. WHEN deployment readiness is checked THEN the system SHALL verify all required environment variables and secrets are available
5. WHEN network security is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure least-privilege network policies and role bindings are configured
6. IF any validation fails THEN the system SHALL block deployment and provide specific remediation guidance
7. WHEN deployment proceeds THEN the system SHALL monitor rollout status and provide real-time feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want post-deployment smoke tests and health validation, so that I can verify critical system functionality immediately after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL execute health check endpoints to verify service availability
2. WHEN smoke tests run THEN the system SHALL validate user login functionality end-to-end
3. WHEN smoke tests run THEN the system SHALL verify recommendation engine functionality with test data
4. WHEN smoke tests run THEN the system SHALL validate admin resource addition workflows
5. WHEN smoke tests run THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity and basic CRUD operations
6. IF any smoke test fails THEN the system SHALL trigger rollback procedures and alert the operations team
7. WHEN smoke tests pass THEN the system SHALL update deployment status and notify stakeholders

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want comprehensive security validation and compliance checking, so that I can ensure the platform meets security standards before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security scans are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure no production credentials are stored in the repository
2. WHEN secret management is validated THEN the system SHALL verify all secrets come from environment variables or secret managers
3. WHEN dependency scanning is executed THEN the system SHALL identify and report vulnerable dependencies
4. WHEN static code analysis runs THEN the system SHALL detect potential security vulnerabilities in custom code
5. WHEN container security is checked THEN the system SHALL scan container images for known vulnerabilities
6. IF critical security issues are found THEN the system SHALL block deployment until issues are resolved
7. WHEN security validation passes THEN the system SHALL generate compliance reports for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive testing and deployment reporting, so that I can track quality metrics and make informed decisions about release readiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing completes THEN the system SHALL update DECISIONS.md with testing and deployment readiness summary
2. WHEN deployment validation finishes THEN the system SHALL log results in handover.md with pass/fail outcomes
3. WHEN quality metrics are generated THEN the system SHALL provide test coverage percentages for all testing layers
4. WHEN deployment readiness is assessed THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive readiness score
5. WHEN moving to production THEN the system SHALL request explicit confirmation before deploying to production namespace
6. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, test results, and remediation recommendations
7. WHEN stakeholders need updates THEN the system SHALL provide automated notifications of testing and deployment status
