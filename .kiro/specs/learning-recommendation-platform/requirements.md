# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HeadStart is an AI-powered learning recommendation platform that delivers personalized learning content to users based on their goals, preferences, and learning history. The platform uses advanced AI embeddings and reranking algorithms to provide explainable recommendations from multiple content sources including YouTube, arXiv papers, and custom uploads.

5. IF content violates platform policies THEN the system SHALL quarantine it for manual review

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Recommendation Engine

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to receive personalized learning recommendations, so that I can discover relevant content that matches my goals and current knowledge level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests recommendations THEN the system SHALL use their profile, goals, and learning history to generate personalized suggestions
2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL use embedding similarity and reranking algorithms to optimize relevance
3. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide explainability scores and reasoning snippets
4. WHEN a user interacts with recommendations THEN the system SHALL capture feedback to improve future suggestions
5. IF no suitable recommendations exist THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative learning paths or content sources

### Requirement 5: Recommendation Explainability and Feedback

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to understand why content was recommended to me, so that I can make informed decisions about my learning path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recommendation is displayed THEN the system SHALL show similarity scores and explanation snippets
2. WHEN a user views recommendation details THEN the system SHALL explain the matching criteria and relevance factors
3. WHEN a user provides feedback THEN the system SHALL capture thumbs up/down, detailed ratings, and comments
4. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL update the user's preference model for future recommendations
5. IF a user consistently rates recommendations poorly THEN the system SHALL trigger a preference review workflow

### Requirement 6: Administrative Content Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to curate and manage platform content, so that I can ensure quality and relevance of learning materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL require elevated authentication and role verification
2. WHEN reviewing content THEN the system SHALL provide tools to approve, reject, edit metadata, and categorize materials
3. WHEN managing content sources THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of ingestion rules and quality thresholds
4. WHEN content is flagged by users THEN the system SHALL queue it for administrative review
5. IF content violates policies THEN the system SHALL provide removal tools and user notification capabilities

### Requirement 7: User Dashboard and Learning Analytics

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to track my learning progress and see analytics about my engagement, so that I can optimize my learning strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display recent recommendations, progress metrics, and learning streaks
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show time spent learning, topics covered, and skill progression
3. WHEN a user completes content THEN the system SHALL update their progress and suggest next steps
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable learning summaries and achievement certificates
5. IF a user hasn't engaged recently THEN the system SHALL send personalized re-engagement notifications

### Requirement 8: Search and Discovery Features

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to search for specific learning content, so that I can find materials on topics I'm immediately interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL use semantic search with embeddings to find relevant content
2. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance, quality, and user preferences
3. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by content type, duration, difficulty, and source
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or related topics
5. IF search queries contain inappropriate content THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs and log security events
