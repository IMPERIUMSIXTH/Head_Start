- Validates business logic integration
- Tests workflow orchestration
- Cross-service data flow validation

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- Complete JWT token lifecycle testing
- Role-based access control validation
- Security feature testing
- Session management validation

### 5. Data Consistency Validation
- Referential integrity across all models
- Transaction consistency validation
- Data aggregation accuracy
- Temporal and JSON data validation

## Requirements Fulfillment

### ✅ Requirement 1.3: Integration Testing Framework
**WHEN** the system needs comprehensive testing **THEN** the system **SHALL** provide an integration testing framework that validates API endpoints, database operations, and service interactions

**Implementation:**
- IntegrationTestRunner class orchestrates all testing
- 60+ tests validate API endpoints comprehensively
- Real PostgreSQL database operations testing
- Service-to-service communication validation
- Complete authentication and authorization flows

### ✅ Requirement 1.8: Data Consistency Validation
**WHEN** data is processed across multiple services **THEN** the system **SHALL** validate data consistency and integrity through automated tests

**Implementation:**
- DataConsistencyTests class with 8 comprehensive tests
- Referential integrity validation across all relationships
- Transaction consistency across multiple operations
- Data aggregation accuracy validation
- Temporal and JSON data structure consistency
- Cross-service data flow validation

## Usage Examples

### Run All Integration Tests
```bash
# Using pytest (recommended for CI/CD)
python -m pytest tests/test_integration_suite.py -v

# Using the integration runner
python scripts/run_integration_tests.py --environment local --suite all

# Simple test runner
python run_integration_tests.py
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Database tests only
python scripts/run_integration_tests.py --suite database

# API tests only  
python scripts/run_integration_tests.py --suite api

# Authentication tests only
python scripts/run_integration_tests.py --suite auth
```
